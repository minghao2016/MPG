# Learn molecular representations from large-scale unlabeled molecules for drug discovery

This repository is the official implementation.

> ğŸ“‹ We provide the code of MPG implementation for pre-training, including the model and pre-training strategies.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Download
All used datasets are public. Please refer to the paper for more details.


## Pre-training 

To pre-train the model from scrach, please run the following command to preprocess the data by PSD and AttrMasking:
```train
python loader.py 
```
Then, run:
```train
bash run_pretraining.sh
```

> ğŸ“‹ To train the model, please download the [zinc](http://zinc15.docking.org/) and [ChemBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) dataset first and put in the `data/raw/` folder.
